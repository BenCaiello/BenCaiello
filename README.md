- 👋 Hi, I’m @BenCaiello
- I h ave a background in Biological / Medical Research Sciences, with experience in "wet labs" doing cell-culture and other molecular biology experiments.
- I’m mainly interested in Computational Biology (or perhaps Cybersecurity!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python: the basics for data science & machine learning. Mainly I need to re-examine & reinforce what I've already learned at this point before going on to new things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to practice datascience on publicly available datasets (Kaggle!)
- 📫 How to reach me here or on Kaggle
